<h3 id="installing-oh-my-zsh">Installing “oh my zsh!”</h3>
<p>Type the following in your terminal and hit enter to install <code>oh my zsh!</code>:</p>
<pre><code>sh -c "$(wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh -O -)"
</code></pre>
<p>(You can check you <code>oh my zsh!</code> <a href="https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh">Github</a> to know more about themes.)</p>
<h3 id="zshrc">.zshrc</h3>
<p>The configuration for <code>oh my zsh!</code> can be edited by editing the .zshrc by opening it any text editors like notepad, VSCode, sublime text, VIM etc.<br>
The address of the file is <code>~/.zshrc</code>. That is, it is present in <code>~</code> or <code>/home/&lt;your_username&gt;</code> directory.<br>
You must keep in mind that when ever <code>oh my zsh!</code> starts it always runs <code>.zshrc</code> file.</p>
<h3 id="adding-default-start-up-directory">Adding default start-up directory</h3>
<p>Every-time you start your wsl you might observe that it opens in a specific directory always. In order to edit that you can tell <code>oh my zsh!</code> to open wsl every-time it in any other directory.<br>
Since the .zshrc file is read every-time <code>oh my zsh!</code> starts, you can add the command in that file to change the directory so that it automatically opens wsl in that directory.<br>
To do that add the following command</p>
<pre><code>cd path/to/the/directory
</code></pre>
<p>to the .zshrc file( in any line)(recommended method). Or you can run the following command</p>
<pre><code>echo "cd path/to/the/directory" &gt;&gt; ~/.zshrc
</code></pre>
<h3 id="adding-a-theme">Adding a Theme</h3>
<p>To add your theme, check out their <a href="https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Themes">Github page</a>, select a theme and add it in your .zshrc file(at around line 11). Remove the default theme and add yours. It should look something like</p>
<pre><code>ZSH_THEME=( "&lt;theme_name_with_qoutes&gt;" )
</code></pre>
<h3 id="adding-plugins">Adding plugins</h3>
<p>You can check out the pre-installed plugins on the <a href="https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/plugins">Github page</a> of <code>oh my zsh!</code>. You can activate those by editing the .zshrc file and following the instructions from line 69 of the .zshrc file.<br>
(You can add other plugins also but the instructions for those are not mentioned in this article.)<br>
The line should look like</p>
<pre><code>plugins=(git macos) //This is for the "git" and "macos" plugins. 
</code></pre>
<p>You can add as many plugins as you want. But remember, plugins make you efficient but too many plugins can slow down the terminal.</p>
<h3 id="disabling-auto-updates">Disabling auto updates</h3>
<p>You can disable auto updates for <code>oh my zsh!</code> by uncommenting the 27th line on the .zshrc file.<br>
It should like</p>
<pre><code>zstyle ':omz:update' mode disabled
</code></pre>
<h3 id="to-exit-oh-my-zsh">To exit <code>oh my zsh!</code></h3>
<p>You can exit <code>oh my zsh!</code> and go back to the normal bash terminal window using the command <code>bash</code> and to enter <code>oh my zsh!</code> again you can enter <code>exit</code> in bash.</p>
