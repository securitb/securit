# SECRET RECIPE

**In a famous cooking school known for keeping its secrets, a legendary chef hid a message in a strange recipe. This message supposedly holds the key to mastering flavors, something only the best chefs know. People say that figuring out this recipe won't just reveal a secret ingredient (like a flag), but a whole new way of cooking that will change everything! Can you crack the code and unlock the chef's secret technique?**

## Hints:
1. **Hint 1:** Being a chef transcends mere profession; it embodies the universal language of culinary arts.
2. **Hint 2:** Numbers can transform into letters.
3. **Hint 3:** 64 ingredients is a really vague number, isn’t it? Maybe it’s related to a specific type of encoding or decoding.
