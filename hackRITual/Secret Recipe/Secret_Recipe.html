                In a famous cooking school known for keeping its secrets, a legendary chef hid a message in a strange recipe.
                This message supposedly holds the key to mastering flavors, something only the best chefs know. People say that 
                figuring out this recipe won't just reveal a secret ingredient (like a flag), but a whole new way of cooking 
                that will change everything! Can you crack the code and unlock the chef's secret technique?
